# Agent Instructions for `forksy-frontend`

You are an AI assistant working on `forksy-frontend`, a React 19 / TypeScript SPA for a food-tracking and meal-planning platform.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Context Files 🚨

Detailed project documentation and strict coding standards are extracted into separate files. **You MUST adhere to the instructions in these files.** Do not make assumptions without checking them.

1. **Rules & Coding Standards**: `.ai/rules/rules.md`
   *Defines guidelines for AI model selection, token optimization, TypeScript/React best practices, performance, state management, and security.*

2. **Project Overview & Architecture**: `.ai/project/overview.md`
   *Defines the feature-sliced folder structure, provider stack, routing, Apollo Client setup, GraphQL codegen, PWA/Service Worker, and known issues.*

3. **Code Examples**: `.ai/rules/examples.md`
   *Correct vs incorrect code patterns for every rule — check this before writing new components, hooks, or utilities.*

## Quick Reference: Most Used Commands

*Detailed information on architecture and environments is in the overview file. Here are the day-to-day commands:*

- **Dev Server:** `yarn dev`
- **Production Build:** `yarn build`
- **Linting:** `yarn lint`
- **Formatting:** `yarn format`
- **GraphQL Codegen:** `yarn generate` — regenerate TypeScript types and hooks after `.gql` changes

## Workflows & Slash Commands

You have access to specialized workflows. When the user types one of these slash commands, use the corresponding workflow from `.ai/commands/`:

- `/review` or `/code-review` — Perform a Senior Frontend Engineer code review
- `/investigate-error` — Debug React / TypeScript / Apollo runtime errors
- `/performance` — Run a performance audit
- `/extract-hook` — Extract reusable custom React hooks from components
- `/explain-code` — Explain code with analogies and diagrams
- `/coding` — General coding assistance with project conventions

**Note:** Do not add new project rules directly to this file. Update `.ai/rules/rules.md` or `.ai/project/overview.md` to maintain a single source of truth.
